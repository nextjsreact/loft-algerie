# Progress

## Completed

*   **Resolved `TypeError`**: Successfully fixed the `TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'includes')` by correctly configuring the database connection.
*   **Database Configuration Consolidation**: Unified the database setup to use a single, TypeScript-native configuration for the Neon driver in `lib/database.ts`.
*   **TypeScript Errors Resolved**: Addressed and cleared all related TypeScript errors by improving module resolution in `tsconfig.json` and providing type definitions.
*   **Memory Bank Initialization**: Updated `projectbrief.md`, `techContext.md`, and `activeContext.md` with current project details and the database migration plan.

## Remaining

*   **Database Migration to Supabase**: The primary outstanding task is the full migration of the database from Neon to Supabase, which includes:
    *   Adapting SQL schemas.
    *   Migrating existing data.
    *   Refactoring application code to interact with Supabase.
