# Active Context

## Current Focus

*   **Database Migration**: The immediate priority is to migrate the database from Neon to Supabase.
*   **Configuration**: The initial database setup has been corrected, and the project is now stable. The next steps will involve migrating the schema and data.

## Next Steps

1.  **Schema Migration**: Adapt the existing SQL scripts to be compatible with Supabase.
2.  **Data Migration**: Plan and execute the transfer of data from the Neon database to Supabase.
3.  **Code Refactoring**: Update the application code to use the Supabase client instead of the Neon driver.
